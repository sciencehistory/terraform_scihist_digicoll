## HLS MediaConvert Video Derivative settings

Terraform doesn't allow us to document the complex settings for video derivatives.

To keep things under control, this directory contains a copy of the JSON that describes the preset settings.

You can view the existing settings by clicking "View JSON or Export Json" at the following four URLs:
